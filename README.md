Usage

Basic Chatbot

Run the script to launch a basic helpful assistant:

The application will start a local web server (typically at http://127.0.0.1:7860) where you can interact with the chatbot.

Retail Sales Assistant


Promotes items on sale (hats 60% off, other items 50% off)

Gently encourages customers toward sale items

Handles specific product inquiries with contextual responses


Dynamic Context Handling

The chatbot can modify its behavior based on user input:


Detects keywords in messages

Applies relevant system message modifications

Provides contextual responses (e.g., redirecting belt inquiries to available items)


 Customization

System Messages

Modify the system_message variable to customize your chatbot's personality and knowledge:

pythonsystem_message = "You are a helpful assistant in a [YOUR BUSINESS TYPE]. 

You should [SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR USE CASE]."

Dynamic Responses

Add conditional logic to the chat function for context-aware responses:

pythondef chat(message, history):

    relevant_system_message = system_message
    
    
    # Add your custom conditions
    
    if 'specific_keyword' in message.lower():
